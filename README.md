# Internship Experience (CBL)

Joined the CBL on Feb 1, 2024. 

Learned the JavaScript for the first time in Code Brew. The final coding test was given and uploaded on the github as directed by the Team Lead.

Total 4 coding questions were given and solved all the questions. Other then this, there was also the Debugging questions given to solve on the paper. Although, the performance was evaluated throughout the month while I was learning the JavaScript.

It was a very good learning experience as I got the guidance of the experienced developers of the company. I have implemented the core concepts of JavaScript under their guidance and learned the how to code efficiently and the practise to write the optimal code.

I hope this learning experience will be benificial for me in my journey as a developer.

Thanking the the company from where I started this journey of development.
